# Agent Workspace

This is the **canonical, harness-agnostic** instruction file for this workspace.
Every AI harness (Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, Copilot, etc.) reads its own
convention file, but those files are just **pointers back here**. Edit this
file — never the harness-specific ones.

> Pointers: `CLAUDE.md` → `@AGENTS.md`, `.claude/skills` → `.agents/skills`,
> `.cursor/rules` → `.agents/`. See "Harness pointers" below.

## Before you implement anything

**Every project in `projects/` follows the
[engineering playbook](docs/engineering-playbook/index.md).** Read it before
writing code, designing an interface, or scaffolding anything in a project —
not after. It is the standard, not background reading: architecture invariants
(ARC-01…08), stack defaults, contract and data-ownership rules, the operational
baseline every deployable implements, and the WP-01…WP-12 delivery roadmap.

Start at the [index](docs/engineering-playbook/index.md), then read only the
page your task touches:
[architecture](docs/engineering-playbook/architecture.md),
[development](docs/engineering-playbook/development.md),
[contracts and data](docs/engineering-playbook/contracts-and-data.md),
[operations](docs/engineering-playbook/operations.md),
[delivery](docs/engineering-playbook/delivery.md),
[knowledge base](docs/engineering-playbook/knowledge-base.md).

Three workspace-owned skills carry the procedure — invoke the matching one
rather than working from memory of this file:

| When you are about to | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Design or change a feature, endpoint, component or service | [engineering-playbook](.agents/skills/engineering-playbook/SKILL.md) |
| Implement an authorized slice, work package or generator | [platform-slice](.agents/skills/platform-slice/SKILL.md) |
| Assess a project, design or diff for compliance and evidence | [platform-review](.agents/skills/platform-review/SKILL.md) |

Two things this does not mean: the parent workspace is not a product (it keeps
its Make/asdf/beads workflow, see below), and a project that predates the
playbook is not rewritten on sight — see "Engineering playbook" for how
divergence is recorded.

## What this workspace is

An **agent workspace** is a parent directory that groups several projects
(referenced as **symlinks** to shared clones) so an agent — and a human in VS
Code — can work across all of them at once. It bundles:

- **Project references** — a committed `projects.yaml` manifest lists clone URLs;
  each project is cloned once into `$AGENTS_GIT_SRC_DIR` and symlinked into
  `projects/`. The workspace pins no project commits (see
  `docs/adr/0004-projects-as-symlinks-not-submodules.md` and `CONTEXT.md`).
- **Agent instructions** — this file (`AGENTS.md`).
- **Agent skills** — reusable procedures in `.agents/skills/`.
- **An issue tracker** — [beads](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads) (`bd`) in `.beads/`.

It is simultaneously a **VS Code multi-root workspace** (`*.code-workspace`),
so every symlinked project shows up as a folder in the editor.

**Homebrew, [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) v0.16+, and [beads](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads)
(`bd`) are hard requirements**, on the same level. Homebrew is the package
manager that installs the other two (including asdf itself), so set it up first.
Homebrew also installs the small CLI utilities the workspace tooling relies on:
**jq** (parses JSON) and **yq** (parses the project manifest). node/pnpm/python/uv/go/ruby/rust are all managed by asdf; each workspace pins
versions in `.tool-versions` (python + uv + nodejs by default — nodejs provides
`npx` for skill management). beads tracks work as issues in a local Dolt
database under `.beads/`.

**Agent-first.** Multi-step, environment-adaptive tasks (installing asdf,
provisioning toolchains, …) are run by *you, the agent*, via skills — not by a
human running commands. The Makefile is the mechanical, deterministic layer and
never invokes a harness. See `docs/adr/0001-agent-first-task-execution.md`.

```

Project clones themselves live outside the workspace, in `$AGENTS_GIT_SRC_DIR`
(default `~/agents/git_repos`), shared across every workspace that references
them.

## Working rules

1. **Harness-agnostic first.** Put instructions in `AGENTS.md` and skills in
   `.agents/skills/`. Never write harness-specific files (`CLAUDE.md`,
   `.cursor/rules`, …) with real content — they only point here.
2. **Projects own their code; the workspace only references them.** A project's
   clone lives in `$AGENTS_GIT_SRC_DIR` and is symlinked into `projects/`. Commit
   code changes inside the project's own repo. The workspace pins no commits, so
   there is no parent pointer to update. Never commit the symlinks — they're
   git-ignored (only `projects.yaml` and `projects/README.md` are tracked).
3. **Keep the workspace in sync.** After adding/removing a project (editing
   `projects.yaml` or the symlinks), run `make sync-workspace` so the
   `.code-workspace` folder list matches `projects/`. `add-project` /
   `sync-projects` do this for you.
4. **Track work in beads.** Use `bd` (`bd create`, `bd ready`, `bd list`) for
   issues rather than scattering TODOs. See "Issue tracking (beads)" below; run
   `bd prime` for the full, current workflow.
5. **Read the engineering playbook before implementing.** It governs every
   referenced project; apply it to new work and record divergence as a project
   ADR rather than treating it as an exemption. See "Before you implement
   anything" above and "Engineering playbook" below.
6. **Don't let projects go stale.** Run `make update-projects` regularly.
7. **Maintain the context map.** This is a multi-context workspace: `CONTEXT-MAP.md`
   at the root indexes each project's context (and `CONTEXT.md` holds the
   workspace's own vocabulary). When you add or remove a project, register or
   remove its context entry and update the relationships so the map never lies.

## Skills

### Engineering playbook

**Every project this workspace references follows the engineering playbook.**
Read [`docs/engineering-playbook/index.md`](docs/engineering-playbook/index.md)
and the task-specific references it links before designing or changing one. The
defaults are a standalone React/Vite SPA, TypeScript/Fastify BFF, and
capability-aligned TypeScript, Go, or Python services. A project that predates
the playbook converges on it: record each divergence as a project ADR with its
intended resolution and track the remaining work in beads — an unrecorded
divergence is a gap, not an exemption, and no request to change one part of a
project authorizes migrating the rest of it. This parent workspace is not a
product; it retains its Make/asdf/beads workflow.

Use [engineering-playbook](.agents/skills/engineering-playbook/SKILL.md) to apply
the standards, [platform-slice](.agents/skills/platform-slice/SKILL.md) to build
an authorized product slice or generator increment, and
[platform-review](.agents/skills/platform-review/SKILL.md) to assess compliance
and executable evidence. These are workspace-owned skills, not external
lockfile entries. Imported skill tooling preferences apply where compatible:
Jest/NestJS guidance does not replace adopted Vitest/Fastify defaults, and
Next.js/Vercel guidance does not change the standalone SPA architecture.

Product implementation commands and WP acceptance gates live in the playbook;
their documentation does not mean the executable template has been built. If the
playbook is unclear for the task in front of you, sharpen the page — do not
settle it in a local reading that the next agent cannot see.

### Workspace and external skills

Skills live in `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Available here:

- **setup-homebrew** — install/configure Homebrew. Run this first when
  onboarding a machine (asdf installs via brew).
- **setup-asdf** — install/configure asdf v0.16+, the blessed plugins, shims,
  and this workspace's toolchains. Run after `setup-homebrew`.
- **setup-beads** — install the `bd` issue tracker (via Homebrew) and initialize
  the workspace's local Dolt database with `--skip-agents` so the harness files
  stay untouched. Run after `setup-homebrew`.
- **setup-projects** — provision `$AGENTS_GIT_SRC_DIR` (env var + directory) and
  clone+symlink the projects in `projects.yaml`. Run after `setup-homebrew`.
- **add-project** — add a new project: record its URL in `projects.yaml`, clone
  it, symlink it into `projects/`, and register it in the VS Code workspace +
  issue tracker.
- **update-workspace** — refresh projects, skills, and dependencies so nothing
  goes stale.

Invoke a skill by reading its `SKILL.md` and following the procedure.

**External skills** from the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) ecosystem are added
with `npx skills@latest add <owner/repo> -a universal` (installs editable copies
into `.agents/skills/`, tracked in `skills-lock.json`) and refreshed with `make
update-agent-skills`. See `docs/adr/0002-external-skills-via-skills-cli.md`.

## Issue tracking (beads)

This workspace tracks work with **bd (beads)**. Issues live in a local **Dolt**
database under `.beads/` (git-ignored); `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive
export, not the source of truth. Cross-machine sync is `bd dolt push`/`pull`,
not committed files.

These instructions live **here, in `AGENTS.md`, only** — the canonical,
harness-agnostic home. `CLAUDE.md` picks them up via `@AGENTS.md`. Do **not**
let `bd init` write its own integration files (it clobbers `CLAUDE.md` and
duplicates this); `/setup-beads` initializes the database with `--skip-agents`.
See `docs/adr/0003-beads-harness-agnostic-integration.md`.

Quick reference:

```bash
bd ready                                    # find unblocked work
bd create "Title" --type task --priority 2  # file an issue
bd show <id>                                # detail
bd update <id> --claim                      # claim work atomically
bd close <id>                               # complete work
bd dolt push                                # sync issues to the remote
```

Run `bd prime` for the full, up-to-date workflow context.

## Agent skills

Configuration read by external engineering skills (e.g. the
[mattpocock/skills](https://skills.sh) set: `to-issues`, `triage`, `qa`,
`to-prd`, `improve-codebase-architecture`, `diagnose`, `tdd`). The details live
in `docs/agents/` so they can evolve without touching this file.

### Issue tracker

Work is tracked in **beads (`bd`)** — the workspace's own tracker. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage roles, applied as `bd` labels (default strings). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

**Multi-context**: `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root indexes one context per project. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Common commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `make setup` | One-time onboarding after cloning (projects, pointers, deps, beads). |
| `make sync-projects` | Clone+symlink every project in `projects.yaml` (needs `$AGENTS_GIT_SRC_DIR`). |
| `make update-projects` | `git pull` every linked project to its default branch. |
| `make update-agent-skills` | Refresh external skills via `npx skills update` (tracked in `skills-lock.json`). |
| `make update-agent-deps` | Update project dependencies (npm/pnpm/yarn/pip/…) in each project. |
| `make add-project URL=…` | Add a new project (record, clone, symlink) and wire it up. |
| `make sync-workspace` | Regenerate the `.code-workspace` folder list by scanning `projects/`. |
| `make help` | List all targets. |

## Harness pointers

These files exist only to redirect a specific harness back to the canonical
sources. Do not put real content in them.

- `CLAUDE.md` — contains `@AGENTS.md` (Claude Code import).
- `.claude/skills` — symlink to `../.agents/skills`.
- `.claude/settings.json` — Claude Code settings (minimal).
